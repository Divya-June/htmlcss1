<ul>
<li>Do not give relationship advice to anyone -friends,family,stranger,none..</li>
<li>Choose what is right for you,not what is right said by the parents..</li>
<li>If someone gives you free advice,just nod as if you're listening. Do not take it personally.</li>
<li>Take advice from people who have suffered/experienced the same situation you are in right now. </li>
<li>Be the decision maker when it comes your life. Live by others decision,you will regret for life. </li>
<li>Make sure to save your earnings before giving everything to your family. </li>
<li>Dress Elegantly. Don't buy cheaper clothes.</li>
<li>Train your physical self for you not for the society or instagram pictures.</li>
<li>Wear braces only if it is life threatening.Visit atleast 5 dentist before if you want to wear braces. </li>
<li>Find Gym nearby. not wasting 1 hour to travel back and forth. So as dentist/dermatologist/clinics for that reason. </li>
<li>Live far away from family-toxic family/relationship if you have a job. Choose mental health.</li>
<li>Many more to come, since this is my first project,i limit myself from being a young boomer. </li>
